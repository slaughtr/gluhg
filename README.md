An app for both the bartender and the customer. This app allows any beer or cider serving establishment to publicly display what's on tap. In addition to this, it also gives a visual representation of the current fill level of each keg. Allows adding, editing, and removing of kegs, as well as a way for the bartender to update keg levels via pint, grumbler, or growler. Adjustable to use the most popular keg sizes.
